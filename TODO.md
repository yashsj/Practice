# DSA Practice TODO

## Current Focus (This Week)
- [ ] Complete 0/1 Knapsack bottom-up DP implementation
- [ ] Solve 3 knapsack variations (bounded, unbounded, subset sum)
- [ ] Document DP recurrence patterns in notebook

## Dynamic Programming (Priority)
- [ ] 0/1 Knapsack - bottom-up tabulation
- [ ] Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- [ ] Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- [ ] Coin Change (min coins)
- [ ] Coin Change 2 (number of ways)
- [ ] Target Sum
- [ ] Partition Equal Subset Sum
- [ ] Edit Distance

## Arrays & Two Pointers
- [ ] Container with most water
- [ ] 3Sum
- [ ] Trapping rain water
- [ ] Sort colors (Dutch flag)

## Sliding Window
- [ ] Longest substring without repeating characters
- [ ] Minimum window substring
- [ ] Sliding window maximum

## Graphs (BFS/DFS)
- [ ] Number of islands
- [ ] Clone graph
- [ ] Course schedule (cycle detection)
- [ ] Pacific Atlantic water flow

## Trees
- [ ] Binary tree level order traversal
- [ ] Validate BST
- [ ] Lowest common ancestor
- [ ] Serialize/deserialize binary tree

## Backtracking
- [ ] Combination sum
- [ ] Word search
- [ ] N-Queens
- [ ] Subsets

## System Design Practice
- [ ] URL shortener design
- [ ] News feed design
- [ ] Rate limiter design

## Notes
- Focus on understanding **patterns** over memorizing solutions
- Write recurrence relations before coding DP problems
- Time-box each problem: 25-30 min attempt, then review solution
- Keep GitHub streak alive with small, meaningful commits
